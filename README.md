## Objectives and tasks
Objectives 
To design the myoelectric control of a robotic prosthesis following a state machine based control scheme.  based control scheme. The simulated environment will allow flexion/extension, pronation/supination and opening/closing movements of the prosthesis,  pronation/supination and opening/closing of the prosthesis. Several state machines will be designed  state machines commanded by flexion, extension and co-contraction movements of the forearm will be designed. 
Tasks 
  - Generate control sequences from the EMG signals available in practice 2.  
  - Implement different state machines that generate the appropriate control commands from the above sequences.  commands from the above sequences. 
  - Implement an environment in which the control actions of each state machine are displayed based on the above sequences.  based on the predefined muscle contraction       sequences. 3. Materials  


Different programs have been used, as well as hardware components, such as:  - Coppelia (V-REP) - Matlab - PC - 3D virtual arm - Autodesk Fusion 360
